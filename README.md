## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Some R Packages I've developed
Most of my package development work relates to natural history museum collections, and germplasm repository work - especially seed banking. 
Essentially, I am always interested in decreasing the human workloads, while increasing the scientific merit of collections. 
All of this work relates heavily around spatial data science workflows. 
If I'm not doing that, then I'm probably making a package for or with a friend!

## Some Species Distribution Modelling things
[Using SDMs to find plant populations for native seed collection](https://github.com/sagesteppe/SDM_restorations)  
[Using SDMs to improve metagenomics results](https://github.com/sagesteppe/SDMS_RMBL)  

## Some Talks
I turn down a lot of talk invitations, but sometimes a very important person tells me I have to do one! 
And that's what we have three examples of here. 

[Modelling Natural History to Increase Native Seed Collection Efficiency; Space, Time, and Connectivity](https://sagesteppe.github.io/Modelling-Natural-History-to-Increase-Native-Seed-Collection-Efficiency/)
